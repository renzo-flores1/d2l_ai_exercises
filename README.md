# Solved Exercises from [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/index.html)

This repository contains 

1. my solutions to the exercises, and
2. a copy of some of the code

in the **Dive into Deep learning** [book](http://d2l.ai/index.html) (also known as D2L). The purpose for copying code is not to literally copy the code itself, but to learn how the syntax of the code works. D2L is written in either MXNet or PyTorch, and I will be using PyTorch to solve the exercises. The code will mainly be found in [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com) notebooks.
